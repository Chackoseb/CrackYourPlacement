Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:
<pre>
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
  </pre>
Example 2:
<pre>
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
</pre>

Constraints:

n == nums.length

1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
